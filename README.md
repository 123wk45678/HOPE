# HOPE-Net: A Graph-based Model for Hand-Object Pose Estimation
Codes for [**HOPE-Net paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00060.pdf) (CVPR 2020), a Graph Convolutional model for Hand-Object Pose Estimation (HOPE).

## Datasets
To use the datasets used in the paper download [**First-Person Hand Action Dataset**](https://guiggh.github.io/publications/first-person-hands/) and [**HO-3D Dataset**](https://www.tugraz.at/index.php?id=40231) and update the root path in the `make_data.py` file located in each folder and run the `make_data.py` files to generate the `.npy` files.
